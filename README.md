## Modding the game ##
You are allowed to edit the code of this game to change the character and enemy images if you would like.

It is not recommended to do so if you do not understand which line to edit.
Please refrain from re-publishing a modded version as the icons you use might not grant you permission to do so.

You can change the player and enemy icons with the provided free icons by changing the name of the file that loads for the player / enemy.
You can change the bullet icon in the same way as an enemy or the player icon.
For the background, if the spaceship of the player, the enemy, or the bullet are invisible, it is recommended that you edit the image and save it in the same format in the same directory to avoid problems with scaling, loading the wrong picture, etc.
